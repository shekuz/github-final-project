Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a basic command-line tool for calculating simple interest based on user-supplied financial inputs. 
It is intended for educational and demonstration purposes as part of transitioning project workflows from traditional version control systems to Git and GitHub.

Project Overview
The Simple Interest Calculator computes the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified time period at a given annual interest rate. 
The formula used is a standard mathematical expression widely applied in finance and lending.

Calculation Formula

The calculator uses the following formula:

Simple Interest = p * t * r

Where:

p — Principal amount

t — Time period in years

r — Annual rate of interest (in percentage)


Input Requirements

Users are expected to provide:

p: Principal amount

t: Time duration (in years)

r: Annual interest rate


Output

The script returns:

The calculated simple interest, based on the formula:
simple interest = p * t * r
